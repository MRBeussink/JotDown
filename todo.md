# To-do

### Drawing Board Ideas

- [ ] Decide about tables.  What should the syntax be?

### Programming Tasks

- [ ] Research Java I/O
      - [x] Implement a test
      - [ ] Check how to take a file name from terminal @cmniccum

- [ ] Research *Finite State Machines* for parsing
      - [ ] Implement a test
      - [ ] Make an interface @mrbeussink

      We can use this to store the output instead of concating to a `String` or gradually writing to a file.  Then, at the end, we'd write that to the output stream.

- [ ] Write interfaces for most of it @mrbeussink

- [ ] Make header for HTML pages @cmniccum

- [ ] Write `Lexer` @cmniccum

- [ ] Write `Parser` @mrbeussink
